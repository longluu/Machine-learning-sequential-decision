# Overall description
This repository contains the code of machine learning model (Bayesian inference) that I use to gain insight from the data I collected on how humans make a sequence of visual judgments. This is basically my whole PhD thesis.

# Model fits the data well with a few interpretable and meaningful parameters
In this project, I collected, cleaned, analyzed and then used Bayesian inference to gain a deep understanding on how humans make sequential judgments of simple visual information. The full description and detail is in my published paper https://elifesciences.org/articles/33334. The code is in directory "BasicModel_eLife". Here I just sketch out some important points with figures taken from the paper.
